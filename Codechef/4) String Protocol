String protocol Problem Code: STRPSolvedSubmit (Practice)
An input string S of length N is transferred through the network using a special protocol. The protocol can send the string through a series of operations. In one operation, we can choose a lowercase english alphabet C and do one of the following:

Transfer 1 copy of C through the network.
Transfer 2 copies of C through the network.
Each of the above transfers take 1 unit of time.

Find the minimum time in which we can transfer the entire string S through the network.

Input Format
The first line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains N - the length of the string S.
Second line of each test case contains the string S.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the minimum time required to transfer the string.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤105
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105.
String S contains lowercase english alphabets only.

Explanation
Test Case 1: String can be transferred through following operations: send 1 copy of character c, send 1 copy of character b, send 1 copy of character c, send 1 copy of character d, and send 1 copy of character c. Thus, total 5 operations are required.

Test Case 2: String can be transferred through following operations: send 2 copies of character a, send 1 copy of character b, send 1 copy of character e, and send 2 copies of character e. Thus, total 4 operations are required.

        if(s[i+1]!='\0' && s[i]==s[i+1]){
            minCount +=1;
            i+=1;
        }else{
