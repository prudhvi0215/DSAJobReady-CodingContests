Fill the Bucket Problem Code: FBCSolvedSubmit


Chef has a bucket having a capacity of K liters. It is already filled with X liters of water.

Find the maximum amount of extra water in liters that Chef can fill in the bucket without overflowing.

Input Format
The first line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space separated integers K and X - as mentioned in the problem.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the amount of extra water in liters that Chef can fill in the bucket without overflowing.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤X<K≤1000

2
5 4
15 6
Sample Output 1

9
Explanation
Test Case 1: The capacity of the bucket is 5 liters but it is already filled with 4 liters of water. Adding 1 more liter of water to the bucket fills it to (4+1)=5 liters. If we try to fill more water, it will overflow.

Test Case 2: The capacity of the bucket is 15 liters but it is already filled with 6 liters of water. Adding 9 more liters of water to the bucket fills it to (6+9)=15 liters. If we try to fill more water, it will overflow.

    while(t--)
    {
        int k,x;
        cin>>k>>x;
